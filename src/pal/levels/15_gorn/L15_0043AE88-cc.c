   angular speeds (the second gets the sign opposite to the first) and goes to state 1, which
   keeps aiming and turns the two angles at +0x688 and +0x6A8.  Both walks keep the second
   `p != 0` guard before the `p[-1]` read and the second walk has a pointer variable of its own
   (one shared variable swaps two callee-saved registers).  Measured: a0 + 0xC0 and a0 + 0xF0
   formed in locals ahead of the second walk make loop.c hoist the two class constants out of it
   (two more saved registers); written at their use after the walk, as below, they stay in the
   loop.  The sign test is a store followed by a conditional store, which gives retail's
   `bc1f` with the first store in its slot and lets the constant 1 be shared by both stores. */
